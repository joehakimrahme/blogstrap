Blogit - yet another static web generator
=========================================

Blogit is a simple blogging platform based on a few core principles:

* **Version control management tools like git implement a lot of useful features for blogging** (like peer review or private publishing).
* **Readers aren't always visiting in a browser**. Blogit puts forward markup languages that emphasise human readability, and serve html only when html is needed.
* **HTML rendering should be done client-side**. It doesn't make sense for your blog to hold both the markup file and its html counterpart.
